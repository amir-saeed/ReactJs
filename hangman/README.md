Hangman - Coding Task
Overview
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. If the player makes too many incorrect guesses, they lose the game.

For more details, please refer to Wikipedia.

Task Description
The goal is to implement a text-based version of Hangman. The game should:

Select a random word from a predefined list.
Display the partially guessed word, replacing unknown letters with _.
Allow the player to guess one letter at a time.
Keep track of incorrect guesses and limit them to a set number (e.g., 6).
End the game when the player either guesses the word correctly or exceeds the maximum wrong guesses.
Example Game Flow
# Game starts
Hidden word: _ _ _ _ _
Incorrect guesses left: 6

> Guess a letter: e

Hidden word: _ e _ _ _
Incorrect guesses left: 6

> Guess a letter: x

Hidden word: _ e _ _ _
Incorrect guesses left: 5

> Guess a letter: l

Hidden word: _ e l l _
Incorrect guesses left: 5

> Guess a letter: h

Hidden word: h e l l _
Incorrect guesses left: 5

> Guess a letter: l (already guessed)

Invalid input. Try again.

> Guess a letter: o

Hidden word: h e l l o
Congratulations! You guessed the word.
Requirements
The word list can be hardcoded into the script.
The game should handle duplicate guesses gracefully (e.g., show a warning but don‚Äôt penalize the player).
The game should display the current state of the word after each guess.
The game should track and display remaining incorrect guesses.
Implement basic input validation (e.g., ignore numbers, special characters, and empty input).
The game should be playable via the command line.
Word List
Use the following predefined list of words for the game:

word_list = ["python", "developer", "hangman", "keyboard", "monitor", "laptop", "program", "terminal", "function", "variable"]
Constraints
The words will only contain lowercase letters (no spaces or special characters).
The game should allow exactly 6 incorrect guesses before ending.
No UI framework should be used ‚Äì it should be fully text-based.
Expected Input/Output
Example function signature:

hangman()
Expected behavior:
The game starts with a random word from a predefined list.
The player is prompted to guess letters.
The game displays feedback after each guess.
The game ends when the player wins or reaches the max incorrect attempts.
üìå Testing
To ensure the game functions correctly, consider testing the following scenarios:

‚úÖ Functional Tests
Correctly displays the hidden word at the start.
Correctly updates the word as letters are guessed.
Handles correct and incorrect guesses appropriately.
Ends the game when the word is fully guessed or max attempts are reached.
‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases
Repeated guesses: The game should not penalize the player for guessing the same letter twice.
Non-alphabetic input: Reject numbers, special characters, and empty input.
Case sensitivity: Ensure the game treats uppercase and lowercase letters identically.
Short and long words: Ensure the game handles words of different lengths correctly.
